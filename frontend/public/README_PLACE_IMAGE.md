Place your new StreetBite logo image in this folder and name it `streetbite-logo.png`.

Recommended sizes / guidelines:
- PNG or SVG (preferred): `streetbite-logo.png` or `streetbite-logo.svg`
- For best results provide a 512x512 (or larger) PNG and a square SVG.
- The app will try `/streetbite-logo.png` automatically and fall back to an inline SVG if the file is missing or fails to load.

Steps to replace the logo:
1. Save the attached image as `streetbite-logo.png`.
2. Put it in `frontend/public/streetbite-logo.png`.
3. Restart the Next dev server if it's running:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

If you want, I can add generated favicons from the image (16x16, 32x32, 180x180) — tell me and I'll generate them if you upload the image file into the workspace.
